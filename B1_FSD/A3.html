        <p class="p1">A smile is the way of showing your happiness, love, friendliness, appreciation and kindness. When you watch a friend doing something silly or embarassing , you smile. When you you are feeling down , seeing someone smile, your heart feels happy and that makes you feel better and probably you have a better day ahead.</p>
